# Column Rendering Fix for Section Widget

## Problem
Widgets were not maintaining proper column bindings when moved between columns, especially across different section containers. This caused widgets to render in the wrong columns.

## Root Cause
The `moveWidgetToColumn` function in `useDragAndDrop.js` was not properly tracking container IDs when moving widgets between columns in different containers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Store Method (`pageBuilderStore.js`)
Added a new `moveWidgetBetweenColumns` method that:
- Properly tracks source and destination container IDs
- Removes widget from source column
- Adds widget to destination column in the correct container
- Includes debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Updated Drag & Drop Logic (`useDragAndDrop.js`)
- Added the new store method to imports
- Replaced the local `moveWidgetToColumn` with store method
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added handler for widget-to-widget drops across columns

### 3. Debug Features
- Console logging at key points to track widget movement
- Logs include widget ID, source/destination columns, and container IDs

## Files Modified
1. `/resources/js/Store/pageBuilderStore.js` - Added `moveWidgetBetweenColumns` method
2. `/resources/js/Hooks/useDragAndDrop.js` - Updated to use store method with logging

## Testing
Created test script at `/resources/js/test-column-rendering.js` to verify:
- Moving widgets within same container
- Moving widgets between different containers
- Preserving widget order during moves

## Usage
The fix is transparent to users. When dragging widgets between columns:
- The system now properly tracks container ownership
- Widgets maintain correct column bindings
- Cross-container moves work correctly

## Debug Output
When moving widgets, console will show:
```
[DragAndDrop] Moving widget between columns: {
  widgetId: "widget-123",
  fromColumn: "column-1-1",
  toColumn: "column-2-1",
  fromContainer: "container-1",
  toContainer: "container-2"
}
[Store] moveWidgetBetweenColumns called: {...}
[Store] Found widget to move: {...}
[Store] Adding widget to container: container-2
[Store] Adding widget to column: column-2-1
```

This helps track the widget movement flow and identify any issues.
